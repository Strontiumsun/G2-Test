You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

## Guidelines

- Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 
- Keep your code as clean as possible. Be sure to use semantic HTML5 markup and reusable CSS classes.
- You may use front-end frameworks such as Foundation or Bootstrap.
- Be creative and feel free to add interacive ehancements with javascript.
